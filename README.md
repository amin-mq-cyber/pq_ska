Experimental Evaluations of Quantum Secure Symmetric Key Agreement (Bash)

Our research began with the urgent need to address the security concerns posed by quantum computing advancements against current public-key cryptography. This concern will materialize when sufficiently powerful quantum computers implementing Shor's algorithm become available. Mosca's Inequality framework highlights the urgency of minimizing the time required to deploy quantum-safe systems, as the timeline for the development of quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptographic methods remains uncertain. Additionally, attackers may already be collecting encrypted data for future decryption, a tactic known as "harvest-now, decrypt-later" attacks. Quantum key distribution, which relies on specialized quantum hardware, faces significant barriers to widespread adoption due to high costs and limited scalability. On the other hand, software-based solutions using post-quantum algorithms come with their own challenges, such as increased resource demands and larger ciphertext sizes.

Recognizing these threats, Arqit recently proposed a quantum-secure symmetric key agreement (SKA) protocol, emphasizing its lightweight and scalable characteristics by initially sharing random secrets encrypted with several post-quantum algorithms and deriving quantum-safe symmetric keys.

The key differences between Arqit's SKA solution and our proposed SKA schemes are as follows:
- Unlike Arqit’s closed-source platform, our proposed schemes leverage open-source tools such as Cosmian for key management, OpenSSL for secret generation, ECDH and Kyber for key generation, and Argon2 for key derivation.
- Instead of using several post-quantum algorithms in the secret-sharing stage, we introduced a hybrid mechanism for enhanced security and included a classical scheme for benchmarking purposes.

Arqit's proprietary nature leaves its performance and scalability opaque. To address this, we developed three SKA scheme variations using open-source components to evaluate the performance and security of this notion of quantum-secure SKA protocols. These variations are based on the encryption methods used during the secret-sharing stage of the SKA process:
- Hybrid SKA: Combines classical and post-quantum cryptography.
- Quantum SKA: Exclusively uses post-quantum methods.
- Classical SKA: Employs traditional encryption methods for benchmarking purposes.

The technical components used in our SKA schemes include:
- TLS Authentication: Initiates the process using RSA encryption.
- Key Generation Algorithms: Utilizes ECDH and Kyber, depending on the scheme.
- Key Derivation: Employs Argon2 to ensure resistance against brute-force attacks.
- Symmetric Key Encryption: AES-256 is used for its proven quantum security.

Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, we observed the following:
- Performance in Various Network Settings: Our SKA schemes demonstrated minimal performance overhead in standard conditions, with a 99 ms overhead for the quantum-only SKA and 199 ms for the hybrid version compared to classical SKA. These schemes maintained consistent performance even under adverse network conditions such as delays, packet losses, and bandwidth limitations.
- Performance in Multi-User Settings: The SKA schemes showed excellent scalability, with approximately 1 second of overhead for every additional 5 concurrent users. Performance improvements of 50-60% were observed by increasing CPU resources. Most performance differences between SKA types were due to the key generation process.
- Security Evaluation Using Shannon Entropy: All SKA schemes consistently maintained near-maximum Shannon entropy values for 256-bit keys, ensuring resistance to cryptanalysis. Notably, cryptographic materials generated by post-quantum encryption algorithms had higher entropy values, which could help distinguish encrypted traffic types, posing a potential security implication.

As an open implementation, our proposed SKA schemes are adaptable to various organizational preferences, enabling:
- Substitution of different encryption algorithms with varying key sizes.
- Integration of hardware security modules.
- Enhancement of key derivation parameters.
- Use of alternative key management software.
- Customization of secret-sharing parameters.

While our research advances quantum-safe communication frameworks, certain limitations remain. The reliance on classical TLS authentication introduces legacy dependencies that may require replacement with post-quantum TLS for complete quantum resistance. Future studies should explore such integrations.

Optimization of the key generation process is also critical, as it is the primary source of performance differences among SKA types. Reducing this bottleneck could enhance scalability and efficiency in resource-constrained and multi-user scenarios. Additionally, the observed entropy differences between classical and post-quantum algorithms highlight a potential vulnerability that underscores the urgency of accelerating post-quantum cryptographic adoption, particularly for long-term sensitive data.
